[_MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual: Tutorial_](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/tutorial.html)

This repository contains the materials and transcript of my run-through of the MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual Tutorial from Monday, July 10, 2017.

Newly-acquired markdown knowledge thanks to [Markdown Tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

I easily saved my transcript with the TMUX scroll (prefix, [), copy (alt-w), and paste (prefix, ]) commands into my Emacs buffer, to then rewrite as this markdown document. I used the Markdown Viewer 3.1 extension for Chrome to preview this document.
